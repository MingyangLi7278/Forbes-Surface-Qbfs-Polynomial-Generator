# Forbes-Surface-Qbfs-Polynomial-Generator
 This project provides a method for rapidly generating Forbes surface Qbfs polynomials using recursive relationships and symbolic computation, suitable for optical processing and related applications. Both the time and space complexity are O(n). The methodology is based on https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.18.019700.
